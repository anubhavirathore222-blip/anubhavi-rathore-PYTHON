-Steps to Install & Run the Project

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Download or copy the project code into a .py file (e.g., expense_tracker.py).

Ensure the script is in the same folder where you want expenses.txt to be created.

Open a terminal/command prompt.

Run the script:

python expense_tracker.py


Enter your monthly budget.

Choose actions from the menu to add or view expenses.

-Instructions for Testing

Start the program and enter any test budget (e.g., ₹90000).

Add multiple expenses using option 1.

Enter amounts like 100, 2000, 3000 etc.
